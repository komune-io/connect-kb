## 1. SOURCES

This methodology is based on the following methodologies:

- AR-ACM0001 Afforestation and reforestation of degraded land

This methodology uses the latest versions of the following tools:

- $C D M$ Combined tool to identify the baseline scenario and demonstrate additionality in $A / R C D M$ project activities
- CDM Tool for the demonstration and assessment of additionality
- $\quad C D M$ Tool for testing significance of GHG emissions in A/R CDM project activities
- $C D M$ Tool for calculation of the number of sample plots for measurements within $A / R$ CDM project activities

This methodology quantifies the GHG emission reductions and removals generated from improving forest management practices to increase the carbon stock on land by extending the rotation age of a forest or patch of forest before harvesting. By extending the age at which trees are cut, projects increase the average carbon stock on the land and remove more emissions from the atmosphere.

## 4. DEFINITIONS

## 5. Clear cut

The harvest of all trees in an area

Commercial harvesting

Removing any trees from the project area for any purpose other than for the limited collection of firewood or sanitation removal

## 6. Firewood

Wood harvested and burned for personal use or limited sale as a heating fuel in the immediate vicinity

## 7. Group selection

A variant of clear cut with groups of trees being left for wildlife habitat, wind firmness, soil retention or other silvicultural goals

## 8. Logging slash

Branches, other dead wood residues and foliage left on the forest floor after timber removal

## 9. Patch cut

A clear cut on a small area (less than one hectare)

## 10. Sanitation removal

The intentional removal of trees to prevent disease or correct a natural disturbance

## 11. Seed tree

A variant of clear cut with limited mature trees being left to provide seeds for regeneration

## 12. Tree

A perennial woody plant with a diameter at breast height greater than $5 \mathrm{~cm}$ and a height greater than $1.3 \mathrm{~m}$

## 13. APPLICABILITY CONDITIONS

This methodology applies to Improved Forest Management (IFM) project activities that involve an extension in rotation age (ERA).

This methodology is applicable under the following conditions:

1) Forest management in both baseline and project scenarios involves harvesting techniques such as clear cuts, patch cuts, seed trees, continuous thinning, or group selection practices.
2) Forests which are not subject to timber harvesting, or managed without an objective for earning revenue through timber harvesting in the baseline scenario are not eligible under this methodology.
3) Prior to the first verification event, the project area must meet one of the following conditions:

a) Certified by Forest Stewardship Council (FSC); or

b) Subject to an easement, or equivalent instrument, recorded against the deed of property that prohibits commercial harvesting for the duration of the crediting period unless later certified by FSC.

4) Project proponents must define the minimum project length in the project description. 5) The project does not encompass managed peat forests, and the proportion of wetlands is not expected to change as part of the project.
5) Project proponents must have a projection of management practices in both with- and without-project scenarios.
6) Where fire is used as part of forest management, fire control measures such as installation of firebreaks or back-burning must be taken to ensure fire does not spread outside the project area - that is, no biomass burning is permitted to occur beyond the project area due to forest management activities.
7) There must be no leakage through activity shifting to other lands owned or managed by project proponents outside the boundary of the project area.

## 14. PROJECT BOUNDARY

### 14.1. GHG Sources and Sinks

The carbon pools included in or excluded from the project boundary are shown in Table 1.

## 15. Table 1: Selected Carbon Pools

| Carbon Pools | Selected? | Justification/Explanation |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| $\begin{array}{l}\text { Above-ground } \\ \text { biomass }\end{array}$ | Yes | Major carbon pool subjected to the project activity |
| $\begin{array}{l}\text { Below-ground } \\ \text { biomass }\end{array}$ | Yes | $\begin{array}{l}\text { Below-ground biomass stock is expected to increase due to } \\ \text { implementation of the IFM project activity. Below-ground } \\ \text { biomass subsequent to harvest is not assessed based on the } \\ \text { conservative assumption of immediate emission. }\end{array}$ |
| Dead wood | Conditional | $\begin{array}{l}\text { Dead wood stocks may be conservatively excluded unless the } \\ \text { project scenario produces greater levels of slash than the } \\ \text { baseline and slash is burned as part of forest management. } \\ \text { Where slash produced in the project scenario is left in the } \\ \text { forest to become part of the dead wood pool, dead wood may } \\ \text { be conservatively excluded. Alternatively, project proponents } \\ \text { may elect to include the pool (where included, the pool must be } \\ \text { estimated in both the baseline and with-project scenarios) as } \\ \text { long as the dead wood pool represents less than } 50 \text { percent of } \\ \text { total carbon volume on the site in any given modeled year. }\end{array}$ |
| Litter | No | $\begin{array}{l}\text { Changes in the litter pool will be de minimis as a result of } \\ \text { rotation extension. }\end{array}$ |
